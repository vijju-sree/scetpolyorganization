        <u>
            Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning
        </u>
    </h2>
    <p2>
        Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning is most popular course.
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two interconnected fields that are central to
         modern computer science and technology. They play a crucial role in the development of intelligent systems 
         that can perform tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence.
         The subject details about AIML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning)
          in a diploma program in polytechnic typically cover a range of topics. These
           may include fundamentals of AI, programming for data science and AIML, discrete
           mathematics, data structure and algorithms, computer vision, machine learning, 
           deep learning, natural language processing, and robotics. The course structure for AIML in diploma 
           polytechnic is a mixture of class lessons, lab work, projects, practical sessions, case studies,
            internships, etc. The AI and ML course is offered at the undergraduate level, postgraduate level, 
            diploma level, certificate level, etc.

                        The elective subjects included in the AI and ML syllabus are Robotics and Automation,
                         Cognitive Computing, Quantum AI, System Modeling and Design, Human-Computer Interface,
                            etc. Core subjects are compulsory while candidates can choose electives as per their interest.

                           The top AI and ML colleges in India are IIT Delhi, VIT Vellore, IIT Madras, SRM Chennai, 
                           etc. Admission to AI and ML is done via entrance exam and on merits.

 AI is the broader concept of creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.  AI that is designed to perform a specific task or a narrow set of tasks.Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, recommendation systems, and image recognition software. A theoretical form of AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. It would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a wide range of activities. Currently, General AI remains largely theoretical and has not been achieved. A hypothetical form of AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects, including creativity, problem-solving, and social intelligence.
Status. This is speculative and a subject of much debate in AI ethics and philosophy.<br><br>
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to
 learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Rather than being explicitly programmed to perform a task, ML algorithms
  use data to learn and improve over time.<br><br>

<h2>
    <u>
        Subject Details
    </u>
</h2>
      
    <p2>
        The details of each semester in a 3-year diploma course can vary depending on the specific field of study. However, I can provide a general breakdown of the semester structure for a typical technical diploma program (such as in engineering, IT, or electronics). This structure typically applies across various specializations with some variation in specific subjects.<br><br>
        We have semister wise examination based on their Regulations(circulam).We have Subjects based on circulam. Industrial training and other all detail related to thier circulam.
        we have to do the project in final year. we have programming labs and they conduct the internals and externals based on circulam.
        In diploma all barnches having same basic subjects in 1st year.<br><br>
        <b><u>Artificial Intelligence Syllabus Overview</u></b><br><br>
        The Artificial Intelligence syllabus teaches students about data collection,

          Swarnandhra College of Engineering and Technology (SCET)
          in Andhra Pradesh, India, like many institutions,has a
          comprehensive anti-ragging policy to ensure a safe and 
          respectful environment for all students.Here’s an overview
          of what such a policy. The policy defines ragging as any act
          that causes physical or psychological harm to students. This
          can include harassment, humiliation, or any form of bullying.
          SCET enforces a strict no-ragging policy, which means that any
          form of ragging is not tolerated. The institution maintains a 
          zero-tolerance stance to ensure that students are protected.
          Preventive Measures Awareness Programs. The college conducts
          awareness campaigns and orientations for students and staff 
          about the ill effects of ragging and the importance of 
          maintaining a safe environment. Rules and Regulations Clear
          rules are established and communicated to students at the
          beginning of each academic year, outlining what constitutes 
          ragging and the consequences of engaging in such behavior.
